# eeg-wings-prototype-idea
I've been doing testing and learning to solder (sob) and how the components work, as well as making a design & general plan & gathering components for a fun idea for a Halloween costume (yeah, I know I'm preparing like 2 months in advance). The general idea is: I modify this EEG headset (done already, but it broke so I'll have to redo it) to send my brain signals to a a microcontroller (I'm going to replace the arduino uno with an esp32) through Bluetooth. Then the microcontroller controls a pair of servos that are hooked up to cardboard & feathers to make "wings", and thus my brain waves can control the "wings" opening and closing!
